# Without LC_ALL=C, some find implementations, including GNU find could
# also list files whose name contains sequences of bytes that don't form
# valid characters in the current locale (like a r√©pertoire encoded in
# iso8859-1 (mkdir $'r\xe9pertoire') in a locale that uses UTF-8 as charset).

for instance in $DEPLOYMENTS
